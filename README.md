This project ports the DLP-7970ABP evaluation board software for the Multiprotocol Fully Integrated RFID and Near Field Communication (NFC) Transceiver IC TRF7970A from MSP430 to STM32F746G-DISCO. Refer to interconnections.pdf document for instructions on how to connect the DLP-7970ABP, STM32F746G-DISCO and TTL to RS232 adapter. STM32 System Workbench IDE was used for this project.
